            <p>
                Sukhna Lake in Chandigarh, India, is a reservoir at the foothills (Shivalik hills) of the Himalayas.
                This 3 km² rainfed lake was created in 1958 by damming the Sukhna Choe, a seasonal stream coming down
                from the Shivalik Hills. Originally, the seasonal flow entered the lake directly causing heavy
                siltation. To check the inflow of silt, 25.42 km² of land was acquired in the catchment area and put
                under vegetation. In 1974, the Choe was diverted and made to bypass the lake completely, the lake being
                fed by three siltation pots, minimising the entry of silt into the lake itself.

            <p>
                A rose garden or rosarium is a garden or park, often open to the public, used to present and grow
                various types of garden roses, and sometimes rose species. Most often it is a section of a larger
                garden. Designs vary tremendously and roses may be displayed alongside other plants or grouped by
                individual variety, colour or class in rose beds. Technically it is a specialized type of shrub garden,
                but normally treated as a type of flower garden, if only because its origins in Europe go back to at
                least the Middle Ages in Europe, when roses were effectively the largest and most popular flowers,
                already existing in numerous garden cultivars.
